horiseon challenge 1 assignment 
this is a website that we had to change the code on to make more accessible and to also condense and get rid of any code that was not needed

the way to use this website is to type or copy and paste the link with the web information which is https://github.com/samt11345/horozion-project/edit/main/README.md
i would like to credit my tutor for helping me figure out the code and my teachers for teaching it!
